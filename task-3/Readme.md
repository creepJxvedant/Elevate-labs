# Task 3: Library Management System (Using OOP)

---

## Objective
Develop a CLI-based mini system in Java to manage **books** and **users**, with functionalities for issuing and returning books.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Java (JDK)**
- **VS Code** / **IntelliJ CE**
- **Terminal / Command Prompt**
`
---

## Deliverables
A **multi-class Java project** implementing:
- `Book` class â†’ Holds details such as ID, title, author, availability.
- `User` class â†’ Represents library members with user ID and name..
- `Library` class â†’ Manages collections of books and users, and provides issue/return features.

---

## Features
1. **Add Books & Users** â€“ Store book and user records.
2. **View Books & Users** â€“ Display available books and registered users.
3. **Issue Book** â€“ A user can borrow a book (availability updated).
4. **Return Book** â€“ A borrowed book can be returned (availability updated).
5. **Menu-driven CLI** â€“ Simple text-based interface for interaction.

---

## Outcome
- Hands-on practice with **Object-Oriented Programming** (Encapsulation, Classes, Objects).
- Exposure to **real-world system design** like a library.
- Improved understanding of **data handling** with collections.

---

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **VS Code** / **IntelliJ CE**.
2. Compile the Java files:  
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the main class:  
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
